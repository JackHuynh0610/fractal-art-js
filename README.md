# Fractal Generator

## What are Fractals?

Fractals are complex geometric shapes that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. This means that as you zoom into a fractal, you'll see smaller copies of the overall shape repeating infinitely. Fractals are generated using recursive mathematical formulas, making them fascinating objects in mathematics and art.

## Usage

This program generates various types of fractals using recursive algorithms. Explore the beauty and complexity of fractal patterns with customizable parameters.
